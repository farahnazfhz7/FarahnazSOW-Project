					<p>America is a relatively modern country, so there aren’t many old structures to be found, unlike for example Italy. This is partially due to the way America came to be. America was not ‘discovered’ by Columbus in 1492, as many people believe, but was likely discovered much earlier by Asian explorers. At the time, Native Americans already lived in the USA. When the Dutch came to the US, they called it “New Netherlands”, and New York became known as “New Amsterdam”. This is why to this day many streets and shops bear Dutch names. Likewise, many American last names sound Dutch, even though America was under Dutch occupation for a relatively short while.</p>
					<p>United States, officially United States of America, abbreviated U.S. or U.S.A., byname America, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states. Besides the 48 conterminous states that occupy the middle latitudes of the continent, the United States includes the state of Alaska, at the northwestern extreme of North America, and the island state of Hawaii, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The conterminous states are bounded on the north by Canada, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The United States is the fourth largest country in the world in area (after Russia, Canada, and China). The national capital is Washington, which is coextensive with the District of Columbia, the federal capital region created in 1790.</p>
					<p>The major characteristic of the United States is probably its great variety. Its physical environment ranges from the Arctic to the subtropical, from the moist rain forest to the arid desert, from the rugged mountain peak to the flat prairie. Although the total population of the United States is large by world standards, its overall population density is relatively low. The country embraces some of the world’s largest urban concentrations as well as some of the most extensive areas that are almost devoid of habitation.</p>
